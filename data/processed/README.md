# What Dataset did I use?

I chose the [**`Statistical Release - Latest reported counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths`**](https://srhdpeuwpubsa.blob.core.windows.net/whdh/COVID/WHO-COVID-19-global-table-data.csv) from the [**World Health Organization (WHO)**'s Covid 19 Dashboard](https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/data?n=c).
